## 3.4 [Defines] Section

This is an optional section. This section, if present, must be the first
section following comment blocks at the beginning of the file.

#### Summary

This section describes the defines section content in the FDF files. This file
can be created by a developer and is an input to the EDK II build tool parsing
utilities. Elements may appear in any order within this section.

The code for this version of the FDF specification is "0x0001001C". New
versions of this specification must increment the minor (001C) portion of the
specification code for backward-compatible changes, and increment the major
specification number for non-backward-compatible changes.

This revision of the specification adds new features. Any FDF file that uses
these new features must use the value `0x0001001C` in the `FDF_SPECIFICATION`
statement. Older FDF files that do not use these new feature do not need to
update the value.

Conditional statements may be used anywhere within this section.

#### Prototype

```c
<Defines>    ::= "[Defines]" <EOL>
                 [<TS> "FDF_SPECIFICATION" <Eq> <SpecVer> <EOL>]
                 [<TS> "FDF_VERSION" <Eq> <DecimalVersion> <EOL>] <DefStmts>*
<DefStmts>   ::= {<MacroDefinition>} {<SetStmts>} {<IncludeStatement>}
<UiNameType> ::= <AsciiString>
<SpecVer>    ::= {<HexVersion>} {(0-9)+ "." (0-9)+}
<SetStmts>   ::= <TS> "SET" <MTS> {<PcdName>} {<PcdFieldName>} <Eq> [<VALUE>] <EOL>
<VALUE>      ::= {<Number>} {<Boolean>} {<GUID>} {<CArray>}
                 {<CString>} {<UnicodeString>} {<Expression>}
```

#### Parameters

**_Expression_**

Refer to the EDK II Expression Syntax Specification for more information.

**_FDF_VERSION_**

The version number for this flash definition; the value is not used by build
tools, but the version element is provided for user tracking capabilities that
may be used by other user interface tools.

**_FDF_SPECIFICATION_**

For this specification, the version value is 0x0001001C. Tools that process
this version of the FDF file can successfully process earlier versions of the
FDF files (this is a backward compatible update). If an FDF file with an
earlier version of the `FDF_SPECIFICATION` is modified to use a feature added
in the 1.28 version of this specification must be updated to 0x0001001C. There
is no requirement to change existing entries if no other content changes. This
value may also be specified as decimal value, such as 1.28.

**_PcdNames_**

PCDs defined in this section take precedence over PCD values specified in other
meta-data files. Note that PCDs defined via the SET statements in sub-sections
of the document can override the values set here as well as in other EDK II
meta-data files.

#### Example

```ini
[Defines]
  FDF_SPECIFICATION                          = 0x0001001C
  DEFINE BIG_STUFF                           = False
  SET gEfiMyPlatformTokenSpaceGuid.MyUsbFlag = True
```
