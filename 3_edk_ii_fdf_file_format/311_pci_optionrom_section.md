## 3.11 PCI OptionRom Section

This is an optional section.

#### Summary

This section is used to specify the content of a PCI Option ROM container. A
PCI Option ROM image may contain zero or more PCI ROM image files - binary
only, and zero or more UEFI driver images, specified by either binary or INF
files, that are to be packaged into a single Option ROM image. Additionally,
support for a single EFI driver with both native (IA32, X64, IPF, etc). and EBC
images in the same PCI Option ROM container is provided.

Conditional statements may be used anywhere within this section.

#### Prototype

```c
<OptionRom>    ::= "[OptionRom" "." <DriverName> "]" <EOL> <Components>*
<DriverName>   ::= (a-zA-Z)(a-zA-Z0-9)*
<Components>   ::= {<InfComponent>} {<Binary>}
<InfComponent> ::= <TS> "INF" <MTS> <UseArch> <InfFile>
                   [<Overrides>] <EOL>
<UseArch>      ::= "USE" <Eq> <TargetArch> <MTS>
<TargetArch>   ::= <arch>
<InfFile>      ::= [<PATH>] <Word> ".inf"
<Overrides>    ::= <MTS> "{" <EOL>
                   [<TS> "PCI_VENDOR_ID" <Eq> <UINT16> <EOL>]
                   [<TS> "PCI_CLASS_CODE" <Eq> <UINT8> <EOL>]
                   [<TS> "PCI_DEVICE_ID" <Eq> <UINT16> [<MTS> <UINT16>]* <EOL>]
                   [<TS> "PCI_REVISION" <Eq> <UINT8> <EOL>]
                   [<TS> "PCI_COMPRESS" <Eq> <TrueFalse> <EOL>]
                   <TS> "}" <EOL>
<Binary>       ::= {<EfiBinary>} {<OtherBinary>}
<EfiBinary>    ::= <TS> "FILE" <MTS> "EFI" <EfiFileName>
                   [<Overrides>] <EOL>
<EfiFileName>  ::= <MTS> [<PATH>] <Word> {".efi"} {".EFI"} {".Efi"}
<OtherBinary>  ::= <TS> "FILE" <MTS> "BIN" <Filename> <EOL>
```

#### Restrictions

**_TargetArch_**

Only specific architectures are permitted - use of "common" or the wildcard
character is prohibited.

**_Paths_**

For BINARY ONLY content (`UEFI_DRIVER` and `UEFI_APPLICATION` .efi files) the
file names specified in `<EfiFileName>` of this section must be relative to the
directory identified by the `WORKSPACE` system environment variable (or
relative to a directory listed in the PACKAGES_PATH system environment
variable). In some cases, the tools will search well known paths for some
files, for example, for FD filenames, the output will typically be located in
the `$(OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)/ $(TARGET)_$(TAGNAME)/FV` directory.

#### Related Definitions

**_DriverName_**

Specifies the name of the created PCI Option ROM image that will be placed in
the build's FV directory.

**_USE_**

Specifies the architecture to use to create a PCI Option ROM.

**_Filename_**

Filenames must match the actual case of the file; three variations are shown
for the .efi extension in the ENBF above.

#### Example

```c
[OptionRom.AtapiPassThru]
  INF USE = IA32 OptionRomPkg/AtapiPassThruDxe/AtapiPassThruDxe.inf {
    PCI_REVISION = 0x0020
    PCI_DEVICE_ID = 0x0A03 0x0B03
  }
  INF USE = EBC OptionRomPkg/AtapiPassThruDxe/AtapiPassThruDxe.inf
```
