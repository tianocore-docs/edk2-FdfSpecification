# 1 Introduction

This document describes the EDK II Flash Description (FDF) file format. This
format was designed to support new build requirements of building EDK and EDK
II modules within the EDK II build infrastructure.

The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation of current Unified EFI,
Inc. (UEFI 2.5 and PI 1.4) compliant binary images.

The FDF file is used to describe the content and layout of binary images.
Binary images described in this file may be any combination of boot images,
capsule images or PCI Options ROMs.
