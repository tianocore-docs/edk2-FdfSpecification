## 1.1 Overview

EDK II tools use INI-style text-based files to describe components, platforms
and firmware volumes. The EDK II Build Infrastructure supports generation of
binary images compliant with Unified EFI Forum (UEFI) specifications UEFI and
Platform Initialization (PI).

The EDK II build processes, defined in the EDK II Build Specification, use
separate steps to create EFI images. EDK Build Tools are included as part of
the EDK II compatibility package. In order to use EDK II Modules or the EDK II
Build Tools, EDK II DSC and FDF files must be used.

The EDK II FDF file is used in conjunction with an EDK II DSC file to generate
bootable images, option ROM images, and update capsules for bootable images
that comply with the UEFI specifications listed above.

The FDF file describes the content and layout of binary images that are either
a boot image or PCI Option ROMs.

This document describes the format of EDK II FDF files that are required for
building binary images for an EDK II platform. The goal is

* **Simplified platform build and configuration** - The FDF files simplify the
  process of adding EDK II modules to a firmware volume on any given platform.
