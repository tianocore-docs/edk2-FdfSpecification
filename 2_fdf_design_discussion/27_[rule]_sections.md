## 2.7 [Rule] Sections

The optional `[Rule]` sections in the FDF file are used for combining binary
images, not for compiling code. Rules are use with the `[FV]` section's module
INF type to define how an FFS file is created for a given INF file. The EDK II
Build Specification defines the default rules that are implicitly used for
creating FFS files. The implicit rules follow the _PI Specification_ and
_UEFI Specification_.

The `[Rule]` section of the FDF file is used to define custom rules, which may
be applied to a given INF file listed in an `[FV]` section. This section is
also used to define rules for module types that permit the user to define the
content of the FFS file - when an FFS type is not specified by either PI or
UEFI specifications.

The Rules can have multiple modifiers as shown below.

`[Rule.ARCH.MODULE_TYPE.TEMPLATE_NAME]`

If no `TEMPLATE_NAME` is given then the match is based on `ARCH` and
`MODULE_TYPE` modifiers. `BINARY` is a reserved `TEMPLATE_NAME` as a default rule
name for binary modules. The `TEMPLATE_NAME` must be unique to the `ARCH` and
`MODULE_TYPE`. It is permissible to use the same `TEMPLATE_NAME` for two or
more `[Rule]` sections if the `ARCH` or the `MODULE_TYPE` listed are different
for each of the sections.

A `[Rule]` section is terminated by another section header or the end of file.

The content of the `[Rule]` section is based on the `FILE` and section grammar
of the FV section. The difference is the `FILE` referenced in the `[RULE]` is a
`MACRO`. The section grammar is extended to include an optional argument,
`Optional`. The `Optional` argument is used to say a section is optional. That
is to say, if it does not exist, then it is O.K.

**********
**Note:** The `!include` statement is valid for any part of the `[Rule]`
section, including an entire `[Rule]` section.
**********

The generic form of the entries for leaf sections is:

`<SectionType> <FileType> [Options] [{<Filename>} {<Extension>}]`

When processing the FDF file, the following rules apply (in order):

1. If `<SectionType>` not defined or not a legal name, then error
2. If `<FileType>` not defined or not a legal name, then error
3. If `[FilePath/FileName]`, then:
   Add one section to FFS with a section type of `<SectionType>`
4. Else:
   Find all files defined by the INF file whose file type is `<FileType>` and
   add each one to the FFS with a section type of `<SectionType>` in
   alphabetical order.
   Add files defined in `[Sources]` followed by files defined in `[Binaries]`

5. If > 1 `UI` section in final FFS, then error
6. If > 1 `VER` section in final FFS, then error
7. If > 1 `PEI_DEPEX` section in final FFS, then error
8. If > 1 `DXE_DEPEX` section in final FFS, then error
9. If > 1 `SMM_DEPEX` section in final FFS, then error

If a rule specifies a file type, instead of specifying specific file names, the
files that match the extension must be processed in alphabetical order.

#### Example

```ini
[Rule.Common.USER_DEFINED.ACPITABLE]
  FILE FREEFORM = $(NAMED_GUID) {
    RAW ACPI Optional |.acpi
    RAW ASL  Optional |.aml
  }
```

Tools must add the processed .acpi files alphabetically, followed by the .aml
files which must also be added alphabetically.

The file would contain:

`<SOF>a1.acpi, a2.acpi, b1.acpi, b2.acpi, a.aml, b.aml<EOF>`

where, start of file is `<SOF>` and end of file is `<EOF>`

Refer to the _EDK II INF File Specification_ for a description of the
`FileType` for binary files.
